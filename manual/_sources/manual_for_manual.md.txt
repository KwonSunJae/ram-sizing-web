# guidelines for writing the manual

Sphinx python library will be used for documentation. 
If done properly, html or tex files can be easiliy generated.

## File formats

This part may be confusing, but we will implement both writing formats. 
Use both *.rst* and *.md*. Test pages will be included.

ReSTructuredText - for files where more automation is needed. RST 
syntax is more complicated, but more flexible.

- main page
- contents generation
- auto doc from the code

Markdown - for files where more writing is needed. MD syntax is simple

- theory manual
- run examples

# TODO


- install myst parser
- run sphinx with autodoc
- 한글 가능해요?
- gen html
- check if documentation can be seen online (gitlab)
- if online is not available, decide on lab hosting
- gen latex / doc
- use figures in GIT-friendly formats (svg), avoid raster (jpg, png)
